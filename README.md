# Overview

In this project, I analyze a set of data pertaining to average the average 
heights of males and females in nearly 200 world countries. I try to 
answer a couple of questions using Pandas data analysis libraries.

I cannot find the precise link of where I found the data, but I got it from kaggle.com.

I am doing this project to learn how to analyze data using Pandas and Python.

# Data Analysis Results

Question 1: What are the top 5 countries with the highest average height
             for males and females, and what are the top 5 countries
             with the lowest average height for males and females?

Question 2: Which continent has the highest average male height,
            and which contintent has the highest average female
            height?

# Development Environment

# Future Work

Things I can fix, improve, and add in the future:
* Learn more methods and functions available in Pandas, to make 
  the data analysis easier and more efficient
* Use established statistical principles to prove hypotheses
* Use more complex datasets to challenge myself further
